# HTML and CSS

* HTML element
  * A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element
  * When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element.
  * The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.
  * The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as hierarchy.
  * `<div>` is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections.
  * If we want to expand an element’s tag, we can do so using an attribute. One commonly used attribute is the id.
* HTML standards
  * We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`)
* Semantic HTML
  * When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic HTML and Semantic HTML. The word semantic means “relating to meaning,” so semantic elements provide information about the content between the opening and closing tags.
* CSS
  * A selector designates exactly which element or elements within our HTML to target and apply styles (such as color, size, and position) to. Selectors may include a combination of different qualifiers to select unique elements, all depending on how specific we wish to be.
  * CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and provide one unified style for all browsers.
